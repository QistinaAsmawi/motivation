<p>Here is a quote from Dr. Marcus Specht, Professor of Advanced Learning Technologies, Open University of Netherlands</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.learnsible.com/home-page/">The students of the future will demand the learning support that is appropriate for their situation or context. Nothing more, nothing less. And they want it at the moment the need arises. Not sooner, not later. Mobile devices will be a key technology to providing that learning support</blockquote>
